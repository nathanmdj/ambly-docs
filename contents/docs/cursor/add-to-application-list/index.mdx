### Follow these steps to add Cursor to your applications list

**Step 1** Move the app from the download to opt folder

```bash
sudo mv cursor-0.42.4x86_64.AppImage /opt/cursor.appimage
```

**Step 2** Create a desktop entry for Cursor by running the command

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/cursor.desktop
```

**Step 3** Paste the following in the file you've just created

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Cursor
Exec=/opt/cursor.appimage
Icon=/opt/cursor.png
Type=Application
Categories=Development;
```

**Step 4** Save the file

```bash
ctl + x
```

```bash
press y
```

```bash
press enter
```

**As Final Step, we should add an icon to the app so you can tell it apart from other applications**

Since we moved the app into the **/opt** directory, add a .png image into the **/opt** directory as well.
The image file should be named **cursor.png** as defined when we created the desktop entry.

If you did all the steps and you application icon is not showing Log Out then login again
